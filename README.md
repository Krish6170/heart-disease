# heart-disease
Data Set Information:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
Only 14 attributes used:
1. #3 (age)
2. #4 (sex)
3. #9 (cp)
4. #10 (trestbps)
5. #12 (chol)
6. #16 (fbs)
7. #19 (restecg)
8. #32 (thalach)
9. #38 (exang)
10. #40 (oldpeak)
11. #41 (slope)
12. #44 (ca)
13. #51 (thal)
14. #58 (num) (the predicted attribute)


Heart_disease_milestone.py is the SOLUTION

It will return two models 
1. randomforest
2. logistic regression


prints base accuracy scores of k-neighbours,logistic regressor,randomforest

prints the best params of the the logostic regressor and randomforest after tuning 

prints classification report at the end
